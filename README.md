# The MITA Programming Language 

ðŸ¥© dada!

MITA (Machine Instruction for Teyvat Automaton) is a programming language that hilichurls use for control Khaenri'ah automaton.
Ella Musk found this source code specification in a remarkable chest and transcripted into English for non-Teyvat people to study.

MITA looks like LISP programming language on Earth, here is an example.

```lisp
(muhe(
	(nye_guru (mita (si) 
		(upa si "mosi mita")
	))
))
